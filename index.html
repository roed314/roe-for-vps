<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I received a great education from public schools in Bellingham, WA. That education prepared me well for college and a career in manufacturing, with an emphasis on optimizing the quality of products. Today, I see that many of the concerns for our future require the ability to analyze how we work on our physical environment: both the buildings in our communities and the natural environment. I believe that our schools can improve the preparation that we give those students who will meet these challenges. We need to step up. Please vote for a school director who prioritizes analytical thinking and the improvement of our infrastructure and our natural environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To serve our community in the oversight of the Vancouver Public Schools (VPS) District Administration in their goal-setting, management and spending.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To serve students and their parents by listening to their hopes, plans, and concerns and integrating them into VPS Board actions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To serve our students in their goals to develop competence, responsibility and compassion to become caring and effective members of our community.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To serve the VPS teachers and staff in their efforts to develop skills and knowledge in our students.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">To serve the VPS Board of Directors in considering pertinent questions about measurable goals that help us achieve our potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Our school district has spent all of our reserves. We continue to spend more than Washington State, our local taxes, and the Federal Government provide to the school district. The only reason that our General fund balance is positive is that we sold some of our district property. Our current forecast is that we will be essentially broke at the end of this academic year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Our school district is living hand-to-mouth. This overspending results in many consequences. We had to manage a painful series of layoffs before the 2024-25 school year. We are re-opening in 2025-26 with fewer staff positions than last year. We have very few uncommitted funds to offer school staff during the next labor negotiations. We are unable to spend money on new opportunities to enable our students to excel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
